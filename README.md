from FAIR(Facebook AI Research) Team ALG,I upload some auto-visualization scripts.
- iteration_loss
  - use the result log to draw iteration and all-type loss curve

- prediction
  - MaskRCNN official solution (Pytorch ver) don't provide visulization for image prediction(Both BBox and Segm).
  I write a simple scripts.
